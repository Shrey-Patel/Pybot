SQLObject is a popular *Object Relational Manager* for providing an
object interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as
instances, and columns as attributes.

SQLObject includes a Python-object-based query language that makes SQL
more abstract, and provides substantial database independence for
applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB (SAPDB).
Python 2.7 or 3.4+ is required.

For development see the projects at
`SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlobject/>`_
and `GitHub <https://github.com/sqlobject>`_.
